# üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration Pull Request

## Migration Type
- [ ] Schema change (add/modify tables/columns)
- [ ] Data migration
- [ ] Index creation/modification
- [ ] Constraint changes
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Changes Summary
<!-- Describe the database changes -->

## Migration Files
<!-- List all migration files included -->
- 

## Rollback Migration
- [ ] Rollback migration created
- [ ] Rollback tested in development
- [ ] Data loss considerations documented

## Testing Checklist
### Development Testing
- [ ] Migration runs successfully on fresh database
- [ ] Migration runs successfully on database with existing data
- [ ] Rollback migration tested
- [ ] Application works with new schema
- [ ] Seed data updated if needed

### Staging Testing
- [ ] Migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Rollback tested on staging
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass

## Data Integrity
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] Data validation queries created
- [ ] Before/after row counts match (if applicable)
- [ ] Foreign key relationships preserved
- [ ] Constraints properly enforced

## Performance Impact
### Before Migration
```
Query performance baseline:
- Critical query X: Xms
- Critical query Y: Yms
```

### After Migration
```
Query performance results:
- Critical query X: Xms
- Critical query Y: Yms
```

### Large Table Considerations
- [ ] Migration time estimated for production data volume
- [ ] Downtime requirements communicated
- [ ] Chunked migration strategy if needed

## Financial Data Impact
- [ ] Financial calculations validated post-migration
- [ ] Historical data integrity preserved
- [ ] Tax calculation accuracy maintained
- [ ] Compliance data intact

## Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Can run during normal hours
- [ ] Requires maintenance window
- [ ] Zero-downtime migration possible
- [ ] Blue-green deployment needed

### Deployment Steps
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Monitoring Plan
Post-deployment monitoring for:
- [ ] Migration completion logs
- [ ] Application error rates
- [ ] Database performance metrics
- [ ] Query execution times

## Validation Queries
```sql
-- Post-migration validation queries
-- Example: Check row counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM new_table;

-- Example: Validate data integrity
SELECT * FROM table WHERE constraint_violation;
```

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Schema documentation updated
- [ ] API documentation updated (if schema affects endpoints)
- [ ] Migration notes added to deployment docs

## Team Coordination
- [ ] Migration reviewed by database team
- [ ] DevOps team notified of deployment requirements
- [ ] Customer support team informed of potential impact
